    "\n",
    "From the website http://redis.io:\n",
    "> Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries. Redis has built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.\n",
    " \n",
    "So that's fairly overkill for what we need, but it turns out that if we turn off persistence, it's a pretty clean solution to what we want.  The idea is that you run a server locally, and all your processes just talk with it.  It's got good bindings for Python and is nice and fast (it's meant for lots and lots of small messages)"

    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can build it from source by following these instructions http://redis.io/download#installation:\n",

    "* ```tar xzf redis-stable.tar.gz```\n",
